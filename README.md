# Microcontrollers
My lab works of Microcontrollers classes as a student of System Engineering(Internet of Things) program in Lviv Polytechnic National University.
1. Run multiple LEDs in different patterns, pattern is changing by switch button
2. Create client side program to connect to the microcontrolelr via COM-port
3. Create timer device with keyboard and LCD display
4. Create timer device with keyboard and 7 segment display using multiple and async timers.
5. Run multiple LEDs in different patterns, pattern is changing by switch button using Assembly
6. Development of a noise-resistant protocol for the data exchange in a network of microcontrollers
7. Create system for data collection from end devices. Also, visualize this data on client side application
